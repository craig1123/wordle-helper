# Wordle Solver

A guide to help you solve wordle so you don't have to think

## What does it provide

- possible words from previous guessed words
- most common letters from possible words
- best words to try made from up to 5 letters and if they exist in the possible words

## Great! How do I do it.

For now, follow the comments in the code at the beginning on where to place your words. Then run

```bash
npm run wordle
```

In the future, I'll make this all command-line based for ease of input
